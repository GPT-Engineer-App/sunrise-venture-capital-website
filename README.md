# sunrise-venture-capital-website

A venture capital firm's website featuring a stunning mountainous backdrop with a sunrise palette of warm colors. The main headline 'We back the most ambitious founders from day one.' is prominently displayed, underlining the firm's commitment to supporting mission-driven founders. The design is clean, modern with a sans-serif font. The navigation bar includes links to Portfolio, Team, Values, and Research sections. A 'Get in touch' button is visible, suggesting a call to action. Below the main banner, four key value propositions are highlighted with icons: 'We invest in audacious ideas', 'We help you build a global business', 'We connect you with top talent', and 'We support your growth journey'. Each value proposition is supported by a brief description and uses a mix of imagery that symbolizes innovation, global reach, networking, and growth. The color scheme should match the sunrise theme, and the layout must be user-friendly and responsive for various devices.
